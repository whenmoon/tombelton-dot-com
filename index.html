  Whilst running 675 Media Tom worked as a music producer, composer, remixer and engineer, splitting his time between working on music for artists and record labels, and projects for media such as television commercials and video game soundtracks. Starting his career 15 years ago (in 2002) producing demos for teams of songwriters who were pitching songs to artists, he moved on to work as an in-house engineer at what was one of London’s biggest recording studios – The Townhouse where he worked on sessions with artists including Brian Ferry, Mary J Blige, Lilly Allen, Take That, Estelle, Corrine Bailey Rae, Damon Albarn, Muse, Snow Patrol and Andrew Lloyd Webber amongst many others. 

In 2009 leaving the studio, he started to take on media, synchronisation and game projects, specialising in electronic / pop music.

He has officially remixed, co-remixed or ghost remixed a diverse range of over 30 artists including Lady Gaga, Bloc Party, White Lies, The Heavy, Hybrid, Kele, MS MR, Coldcut, Jamiroquai, and has contributed over 50 pieces of original music to PlayStation 3 and 4 games. He has written and produced original music used in advertising campaigns by Microsoft, Sony, Nike, Mercedes, Hugo Boss, KFC, Coca Cola, and ASDA amongst others, and has had work broadcast on many TV networks including Sky, BBC, Netflix, Amazon, Nickelodeon and in many TV shows across the world. He has toured and performed on 5 continents and on TV shows including Later With Jools Holland and at festivals including Glastonbury.

As of 2019 he continues to be exclusively published by Ninja Tune / Just Isn't Music.
